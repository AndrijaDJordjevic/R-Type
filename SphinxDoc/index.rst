R-type Project
====================

|

Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation for the R-type project!
R-type is a reproduction of the classic retro game with the added feature of cooperative multiplayer gameplay.
The project is developed as part of the curriculum at Epitech.

This documentation is intended for developers who wish to understand our game engine and create their own game.

|

Project Overview
----------------

The core of the project lies in the development of a custom game engine based on the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture.
This engine serves as the foundation for game development, providing efficient entity management and game logic.
Developers will find this documentation useful to understand the engine's architecture and code structure.
